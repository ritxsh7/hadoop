1. Start hadoop
=> start-all.sh

2. Make directories in hadoop
=> hadoop fs -mkdir /wordcount
=> hadoop fs -mkdir /wordcount/input
=> hadoop fs -mkdir /wordcount/output


3. Make demo.txt and write some sample data inside it. Upload this file on the hdfs
=> hadoop fs -put /home/hadoop/words.txt /wordcount/input

4. Export hadoop classpath

=> Export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)
=> echo $HADOOP_CLASSPATH

5. Write WordCount.java program in current directory
=> touch WordCount.java

6. Make a new folder "container" inside current directory and compile Java program into it
=> mkdir container

7. Compile WordCount.java into "container" folder using above classpath
=> javac -classpath ${HADOOP_CLASSPATH} -d '/home/hadoop/container' '/home/hadoop/WordCount.java'

8. Create Manifest.txt
=> touch Manifest.txt
=> nano Manifest.txt 
Add this line to it : Main-Class: WordCount

9. Create a jar file of all compiled classes in container folder 
=> jar -cvf WordCount.jar Manifest.txt -C container/ .

10. Run the jar file in hadoop and store the ouput in a folder
=> hadoop jar WordCount.jar WordCount /wordcount/input /wordcount/output/output_data
=> hadoop fs -cat /wordcount/output/output_data/part-r-00000
